  - All column names remove spaces

Column Modifications
  id - No modification, all unique, no nulls
  pid - No modification, all unique, no nulls
  ms_subclass- No modification, good grouping, no nulls, changed type to str (Good indicator)
  ms_zoning - No modification, good grouping, no nulls (Good Indicator) (Imbalanced)
  lot_frontage - Filled NA's with zeros (Good indicator)
  lot_area - Good values, no zeros (Good indicator)
  alley - Filled all null values with "OTHER"
  lot_shape - No modification (Good Indicator)
  land_contour - No modification (Good Indicator)
  utilities - No modification, (Not great indicator, most have utilities not very useful - only two do not) Dummified
        converted to 1's and 0's, 1's being having utilities
  lot_config - No modification (G)
  land_slope - No modification (B) Probably not good indicator, most are gentle slopes. 5% are not. Binary now.
  neighborhood - No modification (G)
  condition_1 - No modification (B) Most are in one category. Slightly uncomfortable with a dummy
  condition_2 - No modification (G)
  bldg_type - No modification (G)
  house_style - No modification (G)
  overall_qual - No change.
  overall_cond - Categorical variable, typed to obj since it's not an integer (G)
  year_built - No change.
  year_remod/add - All good, no modification (VG) TIME SERIES Convert to str.
  roof_style - No modifications (G)
  roof_matl - No modifications (Heavily skewed) - dummified - 1 for standard roof 0 for other. turned to int type
  exterior_1st - No modifications (VG)
  exterior_2nd - No modifications (VG)
  mas_vnr_type - Convert all nulls to none, which is the largest column. Still object type (null)
  mas_vnr_area - Convert nulls to zeros, the largest value. maintain type float.
  exter_qual - No modification (G)
  exter_cond - No modification (G)
  foundation - No modification (G)
  bsmt_qual - Converted 'NA' which mean no basement to None, so not flagged as null. Maintain object type (G)
  bsmt_cond - Converted 'NA' which mean no basement to None, so not flagged as null. Maintain object type (G)
  bsmt_exposure - Converted 'NA' which mean no basement to None, so not flagged as null. Maintain object type (G)
  bsmtfin_type_1 - Converted 'NA' which mean no basement to None, so not flagged as null. Maintain object type (G)
  bsmtfin_sf_1 - Converted only 1 value to 0, because checking it's bsmt_cond, it had no basement (G)
  bsmtfin_type_2 - Converted 'NA' which mean no basement to None, so not flagged as null. Maintain object type (G)
  bsmtfin_sf_2 - Converted only 1 value to 0, because checking bsmtfin_type_2, it had no basement (G)
  bsmt_unf_sf -  Converted only 1 value to 0, because checking bsmtfin_type_2, it had no basement (G)
  total_bsmt_sf - Converted only 1 value to 0, because checking bsmtfin_type_2, it had no basement (G)
